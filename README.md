# Zybooks Grading Script 

_Unlike the test grading script, this script will not work for all students. This is due to the fact that students may enter their names different from what is on Canvas or they have dropped the class. I recommend manually entering grades for those students and addressing the class prior to the first reading assignment to match their name to their Canvas name_ 


## What the CSV files need 
The first file is final.csv: this holds all the grades for each student, export this from Canvas and trim all the extra data
For this script, you only want the zybooks grades

The second file is the zybooks.csv, this file holds all the zybook grades as a percentage. Trim all the extra data you do not need 
** Do not forget to make each student's name in this format: **
'<Last Name>' **,** '<First Name>'
